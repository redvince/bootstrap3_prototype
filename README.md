bootstrap3_prototype
====================

Web App Prototype Built using Bootstrap 3 and jQuery.

JavaScript files written for the assignment:
	/js/myQuery.js

CSS files written for the assignment:
	/css/myStyle

All HTML files written for the assignment.

For a demonstration of this JustU prototype you must install a simple web server and test via http:// URLs.

Without using a server, "Same-origin policy" will prevent file system browsing/demoing of this prototype in all browsers, 
with the exception of FireFox (allows limited access to local files). 

If you do not wish to install a web server, I recommend viewing these webpages in Firefox for a limited demo of the prototype.
 
You should also use a resizer tool (http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/) to view how the App will look on different devices.

You should start the Demo with index.html and go from there.

(navBottom, navTop and logoutModal are not App pages themselves, but are used to make up the other pages, so you should avoid clicking these)
